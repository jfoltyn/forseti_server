# FORSETI SERVER

Don't get used to API as it will be a subject of frequent changes. I'll try however to keep them to minimum.

## Running Server

### Prerequisits

1. JAVA installed properly
2. MongoDB is running _(**version 3.6** works, not sure about others)_ [TUTORIAL](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows)

### Steps

1. Navigate into project directory 
2. Execute `gradlew bootRun`
3. Have fun on port `8080`
4. When done, panic `CTRL+C` is the way to go

## Rest API documentation

1. Run server as shown above
2. Go to `/swagger-ui.html`
3. Enjoy

## Nice to have
1. Using terminal for everything is cool, but You may find having Robo3T as MongoGUI attractive alternative [DOWNLOAD](https://robomongo.org/download)
